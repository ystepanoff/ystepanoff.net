  Hello! I'm Yegor, currently working as a software engineer. Before writing code, I earned my PhD in Pure Mathematics
  under the supervision of Prof. Robert A. Wilson and Dr. John N. Bray. For more details, visit my
  <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=279375" target="_blank">Mathematics Genealogy</a>
  page—I’m proud to have
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Horton Conway</a>
  as my academic grandfather. My thesis, titled
  <q>On an Octonionic Construction of the Groups of Type $\mathrm{E}_6$ and ${}^2\mathrm{E}_6$</q> is available
  <a href="/assets/files/Stepanov-PhD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. After all, who wouldn't find
  <a href="https://www.math.clemson.edu/~macaule/classes/f21_math4120/slides/new/tmwyf.pdf" target="_blank">groups</a>
  fascinating?
</p>

<p>
  Aside from doing mathematics and programming, I’m passionate about films, particularly the
  <a href="https://www.newwavefilm.com/" target="_blank">French New Wave</a>. The list of my all-time favourites
  includes Carl Theodor Dreyer’s <a href="https://boxd.it/Jiy" target="_blank">Ordet (1955)</a>, Jean-Luc Godard’s
  <a href="https://boxd.it/20Aw" target="_blank">Bande à part (1964)</a> and
  <a href="https://boxd.it/23UY" target="_blank">Masculin Féminin (1966)</a>, David Lynch’s
  <a href="https://boxd.it/297o" target="_blank">Mulholland Drive (2001)</a>, Stanley Kubrick’s
  <a href="https://boxd.it/29eY" target="_blank"
    >Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)</a
  >, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ystepanoff">many more</a>!

  Another passion I have is baking, particularly sourdough bread. I’m planning to publish some recipes and photos of my
  crusty creations on this website in the near future. In the meantime, if you're interested in getting a taste of my
  starter (I use organic rye flour from
  <a href="https://www.shipton-mill.com/products/organic-dark-rye-flour-type-1350-603" target="_blank">Shipton Mill</a>
  as a base), feel free to send me an email, and we can work out the details.
</p>

<p>P.S. I asked ChatGPT to generate a limerick based on what I wrote on this page, and it produced the following:</p>
<pre>
Yegor, who codes with great flair,
Bakes sourdough with meticulous care.
  With Godard’s strange scenes,
  And his maths-driven means,
He proves logic and loaves make a pair.
