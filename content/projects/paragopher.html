  <h3>ParaGopher</h3>

  <p>
    When I was a kid, I used to play this MS-DOS game called Paratrooper, and somehow when I stumbled upon Ebitengine 2D
    game engine, I remembered that game and decided to make something similar to satisfy my nostalgia. Ebitengine is
    exactly what it says on the tin: a dead simple game engine, so I had a working prototype within a couple of hours.
    Here I wrote down some notes about simple maths under the hood of ParaGopher.

  <h4>Rotating and drawing the turret barrel<h4>
  <h4>Finding the bullet's spawn position (tip of the barrel)</h4>
  <h4>Computing bullet's velocity components</h4>
  <h4>Updating bullet's position (basic kinematics)</h4>
  <h4>Collision checks</h4>
