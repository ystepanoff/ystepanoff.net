    >Last night, our pregnant cat Lyra brought five (!!) new lives into the world. As it turned out, I was more nervous
    than she was. We tried giving her some space, but she followed us every time we left, making it clear she wanted us
    close by. So, we stayed right there until the last kitten arrived. By morning, Lyra looked understandably tired but
    much calmer. I’m still a bit in awe—and excited to watch these tiny bundles grow.
