    >Last night, my pregnant cat Lyra brought five (!!) new lives into the world. I tried giving her some space, but she
    followed me every time I left, making it clear she wanted someone close by. So, I stayed right there until the last
    kitten arrived. By morning, Lyra looked understandably tired but much calmer. I’m still a bit in awe—and excited to
    watch these tiny bundles grow.
