    >I recently rewatched Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Ordet" and suddenly got why this film feels timeless. On one hand, it's
    a thoughtful exploration of faith, doubt, and how they mix inside people’s minds. On the other, it’s simply a
    powerful story about a Danish family struggling with religious differences and personal conflicts. All of this
    gently pulls us into a quiet yet deeply intense reflection on miracles.</p

    >Throughout the film, Dreyer beautifully captures how fragile our certainties can be. Characters face tough life
    situations, and everything—from the slow dialogues to the minimalist visuals—builds a quiet tension, making you feel
    something truly significant is about to happen.</p

    >The climax blends rationality with something mystical (perhaps even to the point of frustration—yet that’s exactly
    what makes it brilliant). In the final scenes, something occurs that's interpreted differently by everyone: some see
    a moment of spiritual awakening, others view it as a symbol of accepting fate. It’s this ambiguity that makes the
    ending of "Ordet" incredibly impactful and memorable.</p
